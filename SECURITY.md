## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

- Email: <SECURITY_EMAIL>

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected repo(s), branch(es), and version(s)
- Any proof-of-concept or logs (redact secrets)

## Response targets

We aim to:

- acknowledge within **<ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_SLA>**
- provide a status update within **<STATUS_UPDATE_SLA>**

## Supported versions

Unless otherwise stated in a repository, we support fixes on:

- `main` (and the latest release branch, if applicable)
