## Quick start

1. Open (or find) an Issue.
2. Create a branch from `main`.
3. Make a focused change.
4. Open a PR that references the Issue.

## Pull request expectations

- Keep PRs small and purposeful.
- Include a clear description of:
  - what changed
  - why
  - how it was tested
- Prefer linking to an Issue (e.g., “Closes #123”).

## Branching

- Default branch: `main`
- Use short-lived feature branches.

## Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- If you squash merge, ensure the PR title is meaningful.

## Asking for help

If you’re blocked, open a draft PR early and ask questions in the PR thread.
