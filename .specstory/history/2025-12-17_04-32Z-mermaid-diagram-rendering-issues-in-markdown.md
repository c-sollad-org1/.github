**Explaining Mermaid rendering**

I need to provide an explanation about rendering Mermaid diagrams using a .mmd file. To view these in VSCode, I require the Mermaid preview extension or I can use GitHub support for Mermaid within fenced markdown blocks. I'll mention renaming it to .md and wrapping it with ```mermaid, with a note that the first line should be `graph TB`. For troubleshooting, I’ll suggest ensuring no leading tabs, correct code fences, and maybe creating a .md wrapper if needed. I'll include steps for both GitHub and VSCode.**Suggesting code changes**

I need to follow guidelines about suggesting code changes using four backticks, and I can propose creating a markdown file named `access-model.md` with fenced Mermaid syntax. Alternatively, I could rename the .mmd file to .md. It's important to explain why this is necessary. I'll mention using the Mermaid preview in VSCode, where the "Markdown: Open Preview" command works only in markdown files. For any needed extensions, I'll highlight "Mermaid Markdown Syntax Highlighting" and "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support," while noting that newer VSCode versions may support Mermaid by default.**Providing steps for Markdown usage**

To work with Mermaid diagrams in VS Code, if I open a `.mmd` file, it’ll be treated as plain text and won't render. First, I need to rename the file to `.md` and wrap the content in a fenced block. I can open the preview using Cmd+Shift+V. On GitHub, the diagrams need to be in a README or markdown file. I can suggest creating a new file called `access-model.md` while keeping the original `.mmd` file for reference, or I could change its extension to `.mermaid`. I’ll provide a minimal example in Markdown format.You’re looking at **Mermaid source text**, not a rendered Mermaid diagram.

### Why it doesn’t “look like a diagram”
- **`.mmd` isn’t automatically rendered** by GitHub or VS Code’s default editor view. It will show as plain text unless a Mermaid-capable preview/extension is used.
- **GitHub renders Mermaid only inside Markdown** fenced code blocks (```mermaid) in files like `README.md`, `*.md`, etc.
- **VS Code renders Mermaid only in a Markdown preview** (and depending on your VS Code version/settings, may require enabling Mermaid support or using an extension).

### Fix options

#### Option A (most reliable): Wrap it in a Markdown file and preview
Create a Markdown wrapper next to your diagram and preview it.

Then in VS Code: open `access-model.md` → press **Cmd+Shift+V** (Markdown Preview).

#### Option B: Use a Mermaid preview extension for `.mmd`
Install an extension that can preview Mermaid files (e.g., **“Markdown Preview Enhanced”** or **Mermaid preview** extensions), then use its preview command on `access-model.mmd`.

If you tell me **where** you expect it to render (VS Code preview? GitHub file view? GitHub Pages?), I can give the exact steps/settings for that target.
