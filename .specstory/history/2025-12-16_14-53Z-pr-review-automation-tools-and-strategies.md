# PR review automation tools and strategies (2025-12-16 14:53Z)

_**User (2025-12-17 01:51Z)**_

Is there a tool or automation that can help me review the PR? A common standarnd tool / feature that does this so user doesn't have to spend  alot of unnecessary time. Provide me a list of ways that I should handl this PR review from best to worse

**Context**: Ways to automate and speed up GitHub PR reviews in a `.github` repo (templates/docs/diagrams), ranked from best to worst.  
**Key Actions**:
- Use **required status checks** (CI + linting + policy-as-code) to catch issues before humans review.
- Add **CODEOWNERS** + **PR templates** to route reviews and ensure consistent info.
- Use **review automation** (Dependabot, Mergify/GitHub Actions) for low-risk changes.
- Use **AI-assisted review** as a supplement, not a gate.  
**Next Steps**: Pick 2–3 items from the top tier and I can help you wire them into this repo’s `` setup.

## Best → Worst ways to handle PR review efficiently

### 1) Required status checks + CI (best, highest leverage)
**Tooling/feature**: GitHub branch protection rules + GitHub Actions checks  
**What it does**: Blocks merges unless automated checks pass.  
**Great for**: Formatting, broken links, Mermaid validation, markdown linting, policy checks, secret scanning.  
**Examples**:
- `markdownlint` (Markdown style)
- `actionlint` (GitHub Actions workflow lint)
- Mermaid diagram lint/render validation (common for `.mmd`)
- Link checking for docs (`lychee`)

**Why it’s best**: You spend time only on *judgment* (is this change correct), not on *mechanics* (does it break formatting/build).

---

### 2) CODEOWNERS + required reviewers
**Tooling/feature**: `.github/CODEOWNERS` + branch protection “Require review from Code Owners”  
**What it does**: Automatically requests the right reviewers and can block merge until they approve.  
**Great for**: Governance repos like `.github`, where changes impact org-wide behavior/templates.

**Why it’s strong**: Prevents “wrong people reviewed it” and reduces review ping-pong.

---

### 3) PR template + checklists (lightweight, very effective)
**Tooling/feature**: `.github/pull_request_template.md`  
**What it does**: Forces the author to include context, risk, validation, screenshots, rollout notes.  
**Great for**: Reducing back-and-forth questions.

**Why it’s good**: Cheap to implement, improves review quality immediately.

---

### 4) Policy-as-code (rulesets + automated enforcement)
**Tooling/feature**: GitHub Rulesets + Actions that validate conventions  
**What it does**: Enforces “no direct push to main,” “PR title format,” “signed commits,” “must include labels,” etc.  
**Great for**: Standardizing across many repos / org compliance.

**Why it helps**: Stops avoidable process issues early.

---

### 5) Review assignment automation (routing + labeling)
**Tooling/feature**: GitHub Actions + labelers + auto-assign  
**What it does**: Auto-labels PRs by paths, auto-assigns reviewers, posts checklists.  
**Great for**: Larger teams, lots of PRs.

**Why it’s mid-tier**: Useful, but not as essential as CI + CODEOWNERS.

---

### 6) Dependency/security automation (when applicable)
**Tooling/feature**: Dependabot + GitHub Advanced Security (code scanning/secret scanning)  
**What it does**: Automates dependency PRs and runs security scans.  
**Great for**: Code repos; in `.github` it’s still useful for Action version updates.

**Why it’s lower here**: Depends on whether you have dependencies and workflows that need it.

---

### 7) AI-assisted PR review (helpful, but not authoritative)
**Tooling/feature**: GitHub Copilot for PRs / Copilot Chat / third-party AI reviewers  
**What it does**: Summarizes diffs, suggests issues, generates review comments.  
**Great for**: Speeding up understanding of changes, catching obvious inconsistencies.

**Why it’s not top-tier**: It can miss context/policy nuances; should not be your only gate.

---

### 8) Manual-only review with no automation (worst)
**What it does**: Relies entirely on humans to catch formatting/build/policy issues.  
**Why it’s worst**: Slow, inconsistent, easy to miss mechanical failures.

## If you tell me your PR scope, I’ll recommend the exact setup
Answer these and I’ll propose the best 2–3 automations for *this* PR/repo:
1) Is the PR mostly **docs/markdown/mermaid** (like `access-model.mmd`) or does it include **workflows** too?  
2) Do you already have **branch protection** + **required checks** on `main`?  
3) Do you want enforcement at **org level** (rulesets) or just this repo?

If you want, I can also draft:
- a `CODEOWNERS`
- a PR template
- a GitHub Actions workflow for `markdownlint` + link check + Mermaid validation
